            <P>We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not
                scouring the
                globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest,
                ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot
                Hawaiians
                and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent
                fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
            </P>

        <div id="child-2 class=" header>
            <P>After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to
                make
                people happy, one topping at a time.</P>
        </div>
        <div id="child-3 class=" header>
            <P>Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style
                pizza his
                family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern
                and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.</P>
        </div>
        <div id="child-4 class=" header>
            <P>Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes,
                made-from-scratch sauce
                and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni,
                salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good
                about eating it.
                And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to
                make you more.</P>
