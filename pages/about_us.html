<p>We’re a small but nimble family-run take out and delivery pizza shop in Okotoks, Alberta. When we’re not scouring the
    globe (okay, the prairies) for the freshest,
    ripest and boldest ingredients, we’re crafting perfect pizzas for you and your family to enjoy. From hot Hawaiians
    and classic Canadians to crispy wings and decadent
    fudge brownies, everything at Okotoks Pizza is baked with love.
    After watching his parents run a very successful pizza business in Calgary, Matt Cleveland learned how to make
    people happy, one topping at a time.
    Opening the doors to Okotoks Pizza in 2004, Matt has managed to evolve the fresh, traditional Greek-style pizza his
    family perfected back in the mid 80s to a more modern
    and convenient comfort food for today’s family on the go.
    Okotoks Pizzas are made with only the freshest ingredients like mozzarella, roma tomatoes, made-from-scratch sauce
    and even features premium toppings like Sorriso Pepperoni,
    salami from Valbella meats and a healthy Flax crust. You feel good about ordering it. You feel good about eating it.
    And you feel even better knowing we're always ready to
    make you more.
